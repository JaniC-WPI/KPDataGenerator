# KPDataGenerator
This repository describes two separate data collection pipeline to generate keypoints on a robotic manipulator to facilitate training of keypoint detection algorithm.
**dream** - Repository of our prior method using camera calibration and robot model
**lama** - Repository of our current method using LaMa inpainting method
**Motion Planning** - Extension of the data collection pipeline to extend an image based motion planning pipeline. (Under construction)
